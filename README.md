# Seestar_run_hexi

This is a very quick put together adding Autofocus and shutdown to Kai's SeeStar Run App.  

The original Seestar_run python code can be found here:  https://github.com/smart-underworld/seestar_run

*  Your Seestar should be in station mode and connected to your home network
*  You need to obtain the IP address of your Seestar.  The example below uses IP address 192.168.1.240
*  Set up your Seestar as you usually would connecting you phone.
*  I recommend you turn on your dew filter
*  The code is run by running a batch file.  schedule.bat
*  Alternatively you can just run it as a one liner
